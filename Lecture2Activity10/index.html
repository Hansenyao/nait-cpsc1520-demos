                The GDPR (but also most data protection regulations) define some categories of personal data as
                sensitive and prohibits processing them with limited exceptions (for example, the user provides explicit
                consent to process that sensitive data for a specific purpose). In particular, the GDPR defines as
                sensitive personal data as: "data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
                philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for
                the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a
                natural person's sex life or sexual orientation."

                In a recent work, we demonstrated that Facebook (FB) labels 73% of users within the EU with potentially
                sensitive interests (referred to as ad preferences as well), which may contravene the GDPR. FB assigns
                user's different ad preferences based on their online activity within this social network. Advertisers
                running ad campaigns can target groups of users that have been assigned a particular ad preference (for
                example, target FB users interested in Starbucks).
